Now practicing Unity's UI.

TextMeshPro our behated.

As there's no random element,
there's little replayability with this one.
(Except aiming for the theoretically best score possible)

Last game was much more enjoyable, I must say,
eventhough that was much more primitive.

At least this gave me a chance to play with 2D platformer camera.

This camera's using the one from Super Mario World:
Platform Snapping & Camera Window for vertical movement,
and Dual Forward Focus w/ threshold triggered for horizontal movement.
